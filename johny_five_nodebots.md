Robots.  JavaScript.  You're already sold, but I'll tell you more anyway.  

In this half-day pre-compiler you will learn the basics of the Johnny-Five API by solving a series of code challenges.  Each challenge includes a set of instructions, 
a suite of tests, and the schematics for the circuit you will be building. 

Seating is limited for this session, and there is a $45 fee for your Photon Microcontroller, breadboard, and all components needed.
