== Let's Build a Hybrid Mobile App! ==

Have you been telling yourself you're going to do mobile, but never
got around to it?  Wouldn't it be awesome if you could leverage
your existing web skills to quickly build native mobile apps?  
In this workshop we'll do exactly that using Cordova. 
Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications using 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By the time you leave this workshop, 
you'll have built an app that can be deployed to iOs, Android, and 
just about any other mobile device. 

Angular experience is nice to have, but not required.
