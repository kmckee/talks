== Learn You Node! ==

We will run through a series of Node.js workshops in pairs. Starting at a basic "HELLO WORLD" and moving on to more advanced exercises about dealing with synchronous & asynchronous I/O, filesystem operations, TCP and HTTP networking, events and streams.  You'll leave this workshop with hands-on experience in the subject of your choice, and the
confidence to continue solving NodeSchool challenges on your own.
