== Back to school!  NodeSchool, that is... ==

In this workshop we will work together in groups to solve hands-on
coding exercises that are part of the open source curriculum
for NodeSchool.  NodeSchool is a project run by volunteers with 
two goals: to create high quality programming curriculum and 
to host community learning events. You'll leave this workshop
with hands-on experience in the subject of your choice, and the
confidence to continue solving NodeSchool exercises on your own.
