== Stop Estimating  ==


Everyone hates making estimates, yet we all do it.  To make matters worse, our estimates are almost always wrong.  This breaks trust with stakeholders and negatively affects the business decisions they make based on estimates.

So, how can we make this better?

In this session we will look at how your team can get out of the guessing business and start basing estimates on real, hard data.  We will also look at how estimation negatively impacts software teams in contrast to the positive influence forecasting has on teams.
